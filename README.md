# MultilayerPerceptron

Multilayer perceptron was used for solving the XOR problem of multiclass classification based on the dataset Iris (which got 3 classes).

In the work were conducted 16 experiments with different activation functions of the hidden layers of perceptron (ReLu, Identity, Logistic and Tahn).

Apart from function, there were experiments on the number of neurons in hidden layers. 

The assessments of the models performance were based on the results of confusion matrix and accuracy.
