# MultilayerPerceptron

Multilayer perceptron was used for solving the XOR problrm of multiclass classification based on the dataset Iris. 
In the work were conducted overall 16 experiments with different activation functions of the hidden layers of perceptron (ReLu, Identity, Logistic and Tahn).
Apart from function, there were experiments on teh numbe of neurons in hidden layers. 
The assessments of the models performance was based on the results of confusion matrix and accuracy.
